# Battle City Phaser

A clone of NES Battle City game built with [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) <br />

_Warning: This is not fully featured game. However I dont intend to do any further development_

## About the project
I built this project as an exercise to learn game development as well as to implement OOPS on a project. Though I am not a game developer and don't intend to be one. Major motivator for starting was OOPS, apart from that I wanted to explore new frontiers of knowledge

## Features
- The player can move all over the map. It has collision detection in place with world object
- Player can shoot one bullet at a time
- Tiles don't break (it's a bug, not a feature really)
- Only brick tiles will break in the up or down direction. For rest of the directions, the bullet is simply gonna explode without any effect on tile

## Getting started
After cloning this repository, run the following commands to start project:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
